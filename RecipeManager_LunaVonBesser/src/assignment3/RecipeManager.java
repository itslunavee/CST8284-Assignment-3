 * RecipeManager is the class that maintains the list of recipes. It also maintains the
way that the RecipeManagerTest (the driver class) gets things done.
- It will read recipes from your hard drive.

- You have been given a Recipes text file to read. Your software must be able
to read from this specific file provided. You are required not to use absolute
paths, but you must use relative paths.

- It has methods that access the list of Recipes in various ways and is the only
class that Assignment3 should communicate with.

-It will also create a shopping list text file, "shoppinglist.txt", which contains
all the ingredients the baker will need to purchase based on their orders.
